# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### 部署到github项目托管
1. 创建React应用： 如果您还没有React应用，可以使用create-react-app来创建一个新的项目。
2. 安装gh-pages： 在项目的根目录下运行以下命令来安装gh-pages，它是一个帮助您将项目部署到GitHub Pages的npm包。
```npm install gh-pages --save-dev```

3. 修改package.json： 在package.json中添加一个homepage字段，值为项目的GitHub Pages URL，例如：
```"homepage": "https://{username}.github.io/{repo-name}"```
同时，在`scripts`部分添加`predeploy`和`deploy`命令：
```json
"scripts": {
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
}
```
4. 部署到GitHub Pages： 运行以下命令来构建并部署您的应用：
```npm run deploy```

这个命令会自动构建应用并将构建的文件推送到GitHub仓库的gh-pages分支。如果一切顺利，您的应用将会被部署到GitHub Pages上，并且可以通过homepage中设置的URL访问。

请确保您的GitHub仓库设置中已经启用了GitHub Pages，并且选择了gh-pages分支作为来源。
